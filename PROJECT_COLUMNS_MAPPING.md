# A&PS Project Columns → Services & LS_SKU Mapping Guide

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Critical Discovery**: Three A&PS Project columns enable complete service recommendation intelligence

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The three A&PS Project columns (**PRJ Practice**, **PRJ Function**, **PRJ Business Area**) are **critical connectors** that bridge historical project delivery data with future service recommendations.

### The Three Columns

| Column | Purpose | Values | Coverage |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| **PRJ Practice** | Service practice area | 4 categories | 100% (2,394/2,394) |
| **PRJ Business Area** | Business domain code | 15 codes | 100% (2,394/2,394) |
| **PRJ Function** | Delivery function | Currently: "-" | 100% (placeholder) |

### Why They Matter

These columns enable **historical pattern analysis** to:
1. ✅ Predict which **Services Practice** to recommend (Consulting vs Engineering vs Data/AI)
2. ✅ Validate recommendations against **historical success** in same practice
3. ✅ Identify **practice affinity** per customer
4. ✅ Calculate **confidence scores** based on past delivery
5. ✅ Align **business areas** with product categories

## 📊 Column 1: PRJ Practice

### Distribution (2,394 projects total)

| Practice Code | Description | Projects | Percentage | Maps to Services Practice |
|--------------|-------------|----------|------------|---------------------------|
| **CLD & PLT** | Cloud & Platform | 1,710 | 71.4% | Hybrid Cloud Consulting + Engineering |
| **NTWK & CYB** | Network & Cyber | 384 | 16.0% | Hybrid Cloud Engineering |
| **AI & D** | AI & Data | 288 | 12.0% | Data, AI & IOT |
| **Other** | Miscellaneous | 12 | 0.5% | General (all practices) |

### Mapping to Services Sheet

```
A&PS Project              →    Services Catalog
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

CLD & PLT (71.4%)        →    Hybrid Cloud Consulting (5 services)
                              - Compute, CS, HCI, OneView
                              - Storage - Advisory, Design & Deploy
                              - Multicloud, Private Cloud-VMware
                              - Private Cloud, Nutanix, Azure Stack
                              - SAP HANA

                         →    Hybrid Cloud Engineering (11 services)
                              - Platform (RedHat, SUSE, etc.)
                              - Virtualization (VMware, Hyper-V)
                              - Storage solutions
                              - Backup & DR
                              - Container solutions

NTWK & CYB (16.0%)       →    Hybrid Cloud Engineering
                              - Network solutions
                              - Security services
                              - SD-WAN, SD-Network

AI & D (12.0%)           →    Data, AI & IOT (7 services)
                              - Data Engineering & Analytics
                              - AI & Machine Learning
                              - IoT solutions
                              - BI & Visualization
```

### Business Logic

**Use PRJ Practice to**:
1. **Filter historical projects** by practice area
2. **Map to Services catalog** practice categories
3. **Calculate practice affinity** per account
4. **Determine confidence** based on past delivery in that practice

**Example**:
```sql
-- Find which practice an account prefers
SELECT
  prj_practice,
  COUNT(*) as project_count,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() as percentage
FROM aps_project
WHERE st_id = 56088
GROUP BY prj_practice
ORDER BY project_count DESC;

Result:
  CLD & PLT: 794 projects (72.7%) ← Account's primary practice
  NTWK & CYB: 162 projects (14.8%)
  AI & D: 130 projects (11.9%)

→ Recommendation: Focus on Hybrid Cloud Consulting/Engineering services
```

## 📊 Column 2: PRJ Business Area

### Distribution (Top 15 business areas)

| Business Area Code | Projects | Percentage | Likely Meaning |
|-------------------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **G400** | 1,224 | 51.1% | Hybrid Cloud (Compute, Storage, Converged) |
| **6000** | 397 | 16.6% | Unknown (possibly regional/product code) |
| **1Z00** | 372 | 15.5% | Unknown (possibly regional/product code) |
| **5V00** | 195 | 8.1% | Unknown (possibly regional/product code) |
| **6C00** | 86 | 3.6% | Unknown (possibly regional/product code) |
| **GD00** | 51 | 2.1% | Unknown (possibly regional/product code) |
| **PK00** | 36 | 1.5% | Unknown (possibly regional/product code) |
| **G500** | 6 | 0.3% | Data & Analytics |
| Others | 27 | 1.1% | Various |

### Proposed Mapping to LS_SKU Categories

Based on G-series codes and practice alignment:

```
Business Area        →    LS_SKU Product Categories
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

G400 (51.1%)         →    Compute
                          Storage SW
                          Storage HW
                          Converged Systems
                          HCI

G500 (0.3%)          →    Storage SW (data platform)
                          Compute (analytics workloads)

G600 (inferred)      →    Switches
                          Network products
```

### Business Logic

**Use PRJ Business Area to**:
1. **Filter projects** by technology domain
2. **Align with LS_SKU categories** for product-service matching
3. **Identify expertise areas** per account
4. **Cross-validate** practice recommendations

**Example**:
```sql
-- Find which business areas an account has experience in
SELECT
  prj_business_area,
  prj_practice,
  COUNT(*) as project_count
FROM aps_project
WHERE st_id = 56088
GROUP BY prj_business_area, prj_practice
ORDER BY project_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

Result:
  G400 + CLD & PLT: 568 projects ← Account's sweet spot
  6000 + CLD & PLT: 185 projects
  1Z00 + NTWK & CYB: 157 projects

→ For storage opportunity: High confidence (G400 = Hybrid Cloud infrastructure)
```

## ✅ Summary: How to Use These Columns

### The Three-Step Recommendation Process

```
1. IDENTIFY (from Install Base + ST ID)
   → Product owned
   → Account ID

2. ANALYZE (using PRJ Practice + Business Area)
   → Query historical projects for this account
   → Calculate practice affinity (which practice they prefer)
   → Identify business area expertise (which domains they know)
   → Compute confidence scores

3. RECOMMEND (using Practice mapping + LS_SKU + Services)
   → Map PRJ Practice → Services Practice
   → Get product-specific services from LS_SKU (with SKU codes)
   → Enrich with Services catalog descriptions
   → Validate against historical patterns
   → Assign confidence score
```

### Confidence Scoring Formula

```python
def calculate_confidence(account_id, recommended_practice):
    # Get historical projects for this account
    total_projects = count_projects(account_id)
    practice_projects = count_projects(account_id, practice=recommended_practice)

    # Calculate affinity
    affinity = practice_projects / total_projects

    # Confidence levels
    if affinity >= 0.70 and total_projects >= 50:
        return "VERY HIGH (95%+)"
    elif affinity >= 0.50 and total_projects >= 20:
        return "HIGH (80-95%)"
    elif affinity >= 0.30 and total_projects >= 10:
        return "MEDIUM (60-80%)"
    elif affinity >= 0.10 and total_projects >= 5:
        return "MEDIUM-LOW (40-60%)"
    else:
        return "LOW (<40%)"
```

### Key Insights

1. **PRJ Practice** = Most valuable column for service recommendations
   - Direct mapping to Services catalog practice areas
   - 100% populated (2,394/2,394 projects)
   - Only 4 values (easy to map)

2. **PRJ Business Area** = Second most valuable for product alignment
   - Maps to technology domains (G400 = infrastructure, G500 = data)
   - Helps validate product-service recommendations
   - 15 values (requires mapping table)

3. **PRJ Function** = Currently not useful (all values = "-")
   - Future potential if populated
   - Could indicate delivery model or service type
