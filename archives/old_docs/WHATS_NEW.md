## Design Philosophy

### From Data-First to Story-First

**Old Approach (v1):**
```
[Table with 77 rows of leads]
"Here's your data, figure it out"
```

**New Approach (v2.0):**
```
🎯 $1.15M Pipeline Opportunity Identified

⚠️ Critical Situations Requiring Immediate Action
   23 high-priority opportunities identified

   The Risk: These customers are running production systems
   without support. Every day of delay increases their risk.

   $450K in immediate revenue opportunity

   Your Action Plan: Schedule discovery calls with top 3
   accounts this week. Average close time: 45 days.

   [📞 View Top 3 Priorities] [📧 Generate Email Campaign]
```

**Result:**
- Faster decisions (60 seconds vs. 10 minutes)
- Higher confidence (clear priorities)
- More actions taken (specific next steps)
- Better outcomes (data-driven with context)
