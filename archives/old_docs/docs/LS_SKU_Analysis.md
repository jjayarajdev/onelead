### Physical Database Tables

```mermaid

    subgraph "Database: onelead.db"
        subgraph "Dimension Tables"
            PROD[dim_ls_sku_product<br/>22 records]
            SERV[dim_ls_sku_service<br/>53 records]

### Mapping Coverage

| Mapping Type | Records | Purpose | Completeness |
|-------------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Product ↔ Service** | 107 | Which services apply to which products | ✅ 100% |
| **Service ↔ SKU** | 14 | Which services have SKU codes | ⚠️ 26% (14/53) |
| **Product ↔ Service ↔ SKU** | 107 | Full quote-ready catalog | ⚠️ 26% with SKU |

**Key Insight**: Only 26% of services have SKU codes. The remaining 74% require manual HPE contact for pricing/ordering.

## Integration with Install Base

### How LS_SKU Connects to Customer Data

The LS_SKU catalog integrates with customer Install Base data through a **3-tier product matching algorithm**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Install Base (Customer Data)"
        IB[Product Description<br/>e.g., 'HPE 3PAR 8200']
    end

    subgraph "Product Matching Engine"
        M1[Tier 1: Exact Match]
        M2[Tier 2: Keyword Match]
        M3[Tier 3: Category Match]
    end

    subgraph "LS_SKU Catalog"
        LS[Product Name<br/>e.g., '3PAR']
        SV[Available Services<br/>6 services]
        SK[SKU Codes<br/>4 SKUs]
    end

    IB --> M1
    M1 --> M2
    M2 --> M3
    M3 --> LS
    LS --> SV
    SV --> SK
```

### Matching Statistics

| Metric | Value | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Install Base Products** | 9 records | Customer-installed equipment |
| **Products Matched** | 3 unique | Matched to LS_SKU catalog |
| **LS Products Matched** | 3 categories | 3PAR, Storage, etc. |
| **Average Confidence** | 95.0% | High-quality matches |
| **Match Rate** | 33% (3/9) | Room for improvement |

### Matching Methodology

#### Tier 1: Exact Product Name Match (Confidence: 100%)
```sql
-- Example: "3PAR 8200" → "3PAR"
WHERE install_base.product_description LIKE '%3PAR%'
  AND ls_sku.product_name = '3PAR'
```

#### Tier 2: Keyword-Based Match (Confidence: 85%)
```sql
-- Example: "HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10" → "Servers"
WHERE install_base.product_description LIKE '%ProLiant%'
   OR install_base.product_description LIKE '%DL380%'
  AND ls_sku.product_name = 'Servers'
```

#### Tier 3: Category-Based Match (Confidence: 70%)
```sql
-- Example: Storage product → Storage category
WHERE install_base.product_platform = 'Storage'
  AND ls_sku.product_category = 'Storage SW'
```

### Integration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IB as Install Base
    participant ME as Matching Engine
    participant LS as LS_SKU Catalog
    participant RE as Recommendation Engine
    participant UI as Dashboard

    IB->>ME: Product: "HPE 3PAR 8200"
    ME->>LS: Match to "3PAR" (95% confidence)
    LS->>ME: Return 6 services
    ME->>LS: Get SKU codes (4 SKUs)
    LS->>RE: Services + SKU codes
    RE->>RE: Calculate urgency (EOL date)
    RE->>RE: Score confidence
    RE->>UI: Quote-ready recommendation
    UI->>UI: Display: Service + SKU + Reasoning
```

### Database Join Pattern

**Complete integration query** (simplified):

```sql
SELECT
    ib.customer_name,
    ib.product_description as installed_product,
    m.confidence_score as match_confidence,
    ls_p.product_name as ls_category,
    ls_s.service_name,
    sk.sku_code,
    -- Urgency calculation
    CASE
        WHEN julianday(ib.product_end_of_life_date) - julianday('now') < 90
        THEN 'Critical'
        WHEN julianday(ib.product_end_of_life_date) - julianday('now') < 180
        THEN 'High'
        ELSE 'Medium'
    END as urgency
FROM fact_install_base ib
INNER JOIN map_install_base_to_ls_sku m
    ON ib.product_key = m.product_key
INNER JOIN dim_ls_sku_product ls_p
    ON m.ls_product_key = ls_p.ls_product_key
INNER JOIN map_product_service_sku ps
    ON ls_p.ls_product_key = ps.ls_product_key
INNER JOIN dim_ls_sku_service ls_s
    ON ps.ls_service_key = ls_s.ls_service_key
LEFT JOIN dim_sku_code sk
    ON ps.sku_key = sk.sku_key
WHERE m.confidence_score >= 70
ORDER BY urgency, m.confidence_score DESC;
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Catalog Completeness

✅ **Strong Coverage**:
- All 22 product categories have services mapped
- Core products (3PAR, Primera, Servers) have 5-7 services each
- 100% product-to-service mapping coverage

⚠️ **Gaps Identified**:
- Only 26% of services have SKU codes (14/53)
- 39 services require manual HPE contact for ordering
- No pricing information in catalog
- No service credit information

### 2. Product Distribution

| Platform | Products | % of Catalog |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Storage SW | 7 | 32% |
| HCI | 4 | 18% |
| Compute | 3 | 14% |
| Converged Systems | 3 | 14% |
| Switches | 2 | 9% |
| Fixed SKU | 2 | 9% |
| Other | 1 | 4% |

**Insight**: Storage-focused catalog (50% Storage SW + HCI), reflecting HPE's storage service strength.

### 3. Service Type Analysis

**Most Common Service Types**:
1. **Other** (18 services, 34%) - Diverse operational services
2. **Installation & Startup** (9 services, 17%) - New deployment focus
3. **Configuration** (8 services, 15%) - Setup and tuning
4. **Upgrade** (7 services, 13%) - Lifecycle management

**Business Implication**: Heavy focus on initial deployment and ongoing maintenance, with relatively fewer migration/integration services.

### 4. SKU Code Availability

**Services with SKU codes (Quote-Ready)**: 14 services (26%)
- OS upgrade services: 3 variants (HM002A family)
- Health Check services: 3 variants (HM006A family)
- Configuration services: 4 variants (HA124A, HA114A)
- Installation services: 2 codes (HL997A)

**Services without SKU codes**: 39 services (74%)
- Requires manual HPE engagement
- Custom scoping needed
- Pricing not standardized

### 5. Product Matching Effectiveness

**Current State**:
- Match rate: 33% (3 of 9 Install Base products matched)
- Average confidence: 95% (high quality when matched)
- Unmatched products: 6 (67%)

**Improvement Opportunities**:
- Add more product keywords to matching engine
- Expand LS_SKU catalog to cover more product variants
- Implement fuzzy matching for product descriptions
- Add product hierarchy (e.g., DL380 → Servers → Compute)

---

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths

✅ **Complete Product-Service Mappings**
- Every product has at least 2 services
- Logical service groupings (Installation, Upgrade, Health Check)
- Consistent 100% confidence scores in mapping table

✅ **Structured Service Taxonomy**
- Clear service type categorization
- Priority levels defined (though all currently = 3)
- Service text descriptions (though currently NULL)

✅ **Clean SKU Code Structure**
- Consistent naming (HM002A, HA124A format)
- Type categorization (Standard)
- Ready for quote generation

### Weaknesses

⚠️ **Missing SKU Codes**
- 74% of services lack SKU codes
- Limits quote-ready recommendations
- Requires manual intervention for most services

⚠️ **Incomplete Metadata**
- `sku_description`: All NULL
- `service_text`: All NULL
- `priority`: All services = 3 (no differentiation)
- `service_category`: All NULL

⚠️ **No Pricing Data**
- No list prices
- No service credits/hours
- No duration estimates
- Cannot generate complete quotes

⚠️ **Limited Product Hierarchy**
- Flat product structure
- No parent-child relationships (e.g., DL380 → Servers)
- Makes matching harder for specific models

| sku_description | 0 | 9 | 0% |
| sku_type | 9 | 0 | 100% |
| service_credits | 0 | 9 | 0% |

**Overall Completeness**: 42% (19/45 fields populated)
