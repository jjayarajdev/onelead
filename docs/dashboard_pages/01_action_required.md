# üö® Action Required Page

**Purpose**: Identify and prioritize immediate business actions that require urgent attention from sales teams.

## üìã Page Overview

The Action Required page serves as the **command center** for urgent business activities. It surfaces critical issues that need immediate resolution, helping sales teams focus on high-impact actions that protect revenue and maintain customer relationships.

## üéØ Key Components

### 1. **Critical Alerts Dashboard**

Three key metrics displayed prominently at the top:

#### üî¥ **Expired Products Alert**
- **Metric**: Number of products that have passed their End of Life (EOL) date
- **Business Impact**: Direct revenue risk from unsupported products
- **Action Required**: Contact customers for immediate renewal or migration
- **Urgency**: CRITICAL - affects customer support and compliance

**Actual Data Display**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è 27 Products EXPIRED
Affecting Account Territory 56088
Action: Contact for immediate renewal
```

**Reality Check**: The system currently tracks products for a single account territory (56088) with 27 products that have passed their EOL dates, including HP DL360p Gen8 servers from 2015 and various storage components.

#### üí∏ **Unused Credits Alert** 
- **Metric**: Number of service credits purchased but not utilized
- **Business Impact**: Customer dissatisfaction and potential contract non-renewal
- **Action Required**: Schedule utilization review meetings
- **Urgency**: HIGH - impacts customer satisfaction and retention

**Simulated Display** (Note: No actual service credits in current data):
```
üí∏ Service Credits Feature
Currently showing simulated data
Action: Integrate actual service credit data source
```

**Reality Check**: The current dataset does not contain service credit information. The dashboard simulates this data for demonstration purposes.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unsupported Products Alert**
- **Metric**: Products without active support coverage
- **Business Impact**: Operational risk and potential service disruption
- **Action Required**: Propose support renewal packages
- **Urgency**: MEDIUM - proactive risk mitigation

### 2. **Customer Action Priority List**

A comprehensive table showing customers ranked by urgency:

| Field | Description | Business Value |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Account Territory** | Sales territory ID (currently 56088) | Account identification |
| **Products** | Total products owned (currently 63) | Relationship depth indicator |
| **Expired** | Count of expired/EOL products (currently 27) | Immediate risk assessment |
| **Opportunities** | Simulated opportunities count | Growth potential (requires integration) |
| **Priority Level** | üî¥ CRITICAL / üü° HIGH / üü¢ MEDIUM | Action prioritization |

**Priority Calculation Logic**:
- üî¥ **CRITICAL**: Customers with expired products (immediate revenue risk)
- üü° **HIGH**: Customers with high opportunity count but no expired products
- üü¢ **MEDIUM**: Customers with moderate activity levels

### 3. **Urgent Product Lifecycle Issues**

Detailed breakdown of products requiring immediate attention:

#### **End of Life (EOL) Products**
- Products that have reached end of support
- Days overdue (negative values indicate expired)
- Support status and replacement recommendations
- Customer impact assessment

#### **End of Service (EOS) Products**  
- Products approaching service discontinuation
- Timeline for action (30, 60, 90 days)
- Migration path recommendations
- Customer communication templates
