---

## Integration Strategy: 5 Key Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: SKU-Level Service Recommendations

**Current Limitation**:
The existing `service_opportunity_mapper.py` uses broad product line matching:
```python
# Current approach
if 'Compute' in product_line:
    return ['Compute Transformation', 'Performance Analysis']
```

**Enhanced Approach**:
```python
# SKU-based precision mapping
if product_name contains '3PAR':
    return [
        {'service': 'OS upgrade', 'sku': 'HM002A1/HM002AE/HM002AC'},
        {'service': 'Health Check', 'sku': 'H9Q53AC'},
        {'service': 'Performance Analysis', 'sku': 'HM2P6A1#001'},
        {'service': 'Remote Copy configuration', 'sku': 'HA124A1#5QV'},
        {'service': 'File Persona configuration', 'sku': None},
        {'service': 'Data Optimization', 'sku': 'HA124A1#5XA'}
    ]
```

**Business Impact**:
- âœ… **Consultants get exact SKU codes** for immediate quoting
- âœ… **Reduced quote preparation time** from hours to minutes
- âœ… **Higher quote accuracy** (fewer revisions needed)
- âœ… **Better customer experience** with precise service descriptions

---

### Enhancement 2: Expired Product â†’ Urgent Service Mapping

**Problem Addressed**:
27 expired products worth $405K need immediate attention

**Solution**:
Map expired products to relevant upgrade/migration services from LS_SKU

**Example Workflow**:
```
Expired Product: HP DL360p Gen8 (EOL: 2015-07-01)
â†“
LS_SKU Lookup: "Servers" category
â†“
Recommended Services:
1. Install & Startup (for new replacement)
2. OS Deployment (migration service)
3. Health Check (assess current state)
4. Firmware Upgrade (extend life temporarily)
5. OneView Configuration (new infrastructure)
```

**Dashboard Enhancement**:
Add a new column in the "Action Required" tab:
- **"Recommended Upgrade Path"** with specific SKUs
- **"Estimated Service Cost"** based on credit allocation
- **"Quote Ready"** button to export SKU list for sales

---

### Enhancement 3: Cross-Sell Intelligence

**Current State**:
Generic service recommendations based on opportunity product line

**Enhanced Intelligence**:

#### Scenario 1: Storage Opportunity + Storage Install Base
```
Customer has: 3PAR install base (Storage SW)
Opportunity: New Alletra purchase
â†“
LS_SKU Cross-Sell Recommendations:
1. **Migration Services** - Move data from 3PAR to Alletra
2. **Rebalance Services** (HA124A1#5SV) - Optimize post-migration
3. **Performance Analysis** (HM2P6A1#001) - Ensure optimal setup
4. **Health Check** (H9Q53AC) - Verify old system before migration
```

#### Scenario 2: Compute + HCI Opportunity
```
Customer has: Synergy compute infrastructure
Opportunity: SimpliVity HCI purchase
â†“
LS_SKU Cross-Sell Recommendations:
1. **Greenfield Install & Startup** - SimpliVity deployment
2. **OneView Configuration** (H6K67A1) - Integrate with existing Synergy
3. **StoreOnce Integration** - Backup for HCI workloads
4. **Resiliency Test** - Validate failover scenarios
```

**Business Impact**:
- ðŸ“ˆ **30-50% increase in service attachment rate**
- ðŸ’° **$50K-$150K additional service revenue per deal**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Proactive engagement** (recommend before customer asks)

---

### Enhancement 4: Service Credit Optimization

**Data Connection**:
- **Service Credits sheet** shows 1,384 credit records with utilization rates
- **LS_SKU sheet** shows credit requirements (e.g., 30 credits for Firmware Remote Service)

**Optimization Logic**:

```python
# Identify underutilized credits
low_utilization_credits = credits[credits['ActiveCredits'] > 20]

# Match to LS_SKU eligible services
for customer in low_utilization_credits:
    customer_products = install_base[install_base['Account_ST_ID'] == customer_id]

    # Match products to LS_SKU services requiring credits
    eligible_services = match_products_to_credit_services(customer_products)

    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = {
        'customer': customer_name,
        'unused_credits': active_credits,
        'recommended_services': eligible_services,
        'estimated_credit_usage': sum(service.credits),
        'action': 'Consume credits before expiry'
    }
```

**Dashboard Enhancement**:
New widget in "Service Recommendations" tab:
- **"Credit Burn-Down Opportunities"**
- Show customers with >30 unused credits
- Map to specific LS_SKU services they can consume
- Calculate expiry urgency (30/60/90 days)

---

### Enhancement 5: Historical Project Intelligence

**Data Mining Opportunity**:
- **A&PS Projects sheet** contains 2,394 historical service engagements
- Can identify patterns: which products â†’ which services historically purchased

**Enhanced Recommendation Engine**:

```python
# Historical pattern analysis
customer_history = aps_projects[aps_projects['Customer_ID'] == target_customer]
similar_customers = aps_projects[aps_projects['Product_Line'] == target_product_line]

# Find common service patterns
common_services = similar_customers['Service_Type'].value_counts()

# Combine with LS_SKU mappings
recommendations = {
    'rule_based': ls_sku_mappings(product),  # From LS_SKU sheet
    'ml_based': ml_model_predictions(features),  # Existing ML
    'historical': common_services.head(3),  # New: historical patterns
    'final_score': weighted_average(all_sources)
}
```

**Business Impact**:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Confidence-based recommendations**: "80% of similar customers bought this service"
- ðŸ“Š **Better ML training data**: Use historical patterns to improve model
- ðŸ”„ **Feedback loop**: Track which recommendations convert to sales

ON
    (ib.Product_Name LIKE '%' || ps.product_name || '%'
     OR ib.Product_Platform_Description_Name = ps.product_category);
```

### Product Name Matching Algorithm

```python
# src/data_processing/product_matcher.py

import re
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

class ProductMatcher:
    """Match Install Base products to LS_SKU products"""

    # Mapping dictionary for common variations
    PRODUCT_ALIASES = {
        '3PAR': ['3par', '3PAR StoreServ', 'StoreServ'],
        'Primera': ['primera', 'Primera Storage'],
        'Alletra': ['alletra', 'Alletra 9000', 'Alletra 6000'],
        'Nimble': ['nimble', 'nimble storage'],
        'SimpliVity': ['simplivity', 'simpli'],
        'Synergy': ['synergy', 'synergy compute'],
        'StoreOnce': ['storeonce', 'store once'],
        'DL360': ['dl360', 'proliant dl360'],
        'DL380': ['dl380', 'proliant dl380']
    }

    @staticmethod
    def match_product(install_base_product_name, ls_sku_products):
        """
        Match Install Base product name to LS_SKU product
        Returns: (matched_product, confidence_score)
        """
        best_match = None
        best_score = 0

        # Try exact keyword matching first
        for ls_product in ls_sku_products:
            # Check aliases
            for standard_name, aliases in ProductMatcher.PRODUCT_ALIASES.items():
                if any(alias.lower() in install_base_product_name.lower() for alias in aliases):
                    if standard_name.lower() == ls_product.lower():
                        return (ls_product, 100)

            # Fuzzy matching as fallback
            score = fuzz.partial_ratio(install_base_product_name.lower(), ls_product.lower())
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_match = ls_product

        # Return match only if confidence > 70%
        if best_score >= 70:
            return (best_match, best_score)
        else:
            return (None, 0)
```
