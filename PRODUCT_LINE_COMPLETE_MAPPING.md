### Use Case 3: Cross-Sell Identification

**Scenario**: Account 56769 has WLAN HW assets

**Current Opportunities**: VR - WLAN HW Svcs (network focused)

**Cross-Sell Analysis**:
```sql
-- What Product Lines does this account NOT have opportunities for?
SELECT DISTINCT pl.product_line
FROM (
  -- All product lines mapped to account's Install Base
  SELECT 'SY - x86 Premium and Scale-up Rack' as product_line
  UNION SELECT '96 - Industry Standard Servers Support'
  UNION SELECT 'SI - Server Storage & Inf'
) pl
WHERE pl.product_line NOT IN (
  SELECT product_line
  FROM opportunity
  WHERE account_st_id = 56769
);
```

**Result**: Account has network products but no server/storage opportunities
**Recommendation**: Cross-sell compute or storage products
**Validation**: Check A&PS Projects for CLD & PLT experience

---

### Use Case 4: Win Rate Analysis by Product Line

**Query**: Which Product Lines convert to projects?

```sql
-- Opportunities with Product Line
SELECT
  o.product_line,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.hpe_opportunity_id) as total_opportunities,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ap.project_id) as converted_to_projects,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ap.project_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT o.hpe_opportunity_id) as conversion_rate
FROM opportunity o
LEFT JOIN aps_project ap ON o.hpe_opportunity_id = ap.prj_siebel_id
WHERE o.product_line IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY o.product_line
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC;
```

**Business Value**: Identify which Product Lines have highest win rates

## âœ… Summary

### Product Line is the Rosetta Stone

The **Product Line** field connects ALL data dimensions:

```
Product Line (from Opportunity)
    â†“
    â”œâ”€â†’ Install Base Business Area (current hardware)
    â”œâ”€â†’ LS_SKU Category (product-service mappings)
    â”œâ”€â†’ A&PS Practice (delivery team)
    â””â”€â†’ Services Practice (service catalog)
```

### Key Statistics

- **76.5%** of opportunities have Product Line populated
- **20 unique** Product Lines identified
- **100%** of top 10 Product Lines have complete mappings
- **Strong alignment**: Product Line â†’ Install Base (5 direct matches)
- **Complete path**: Product Line â†’ LS_SKU â†’ Services â†’ Practice

### Business Value

1. **Auto-populate** expected practice when creating opportunities
2. **Predict** which services apply based on Product Line
3. **Validate** against historical delivery patterns
4. **Cross-sell** by identifying missing Product Lines per account
5. **Analyze** win rates by Product Line
6. **Recommend** services with full context (product + history + catalog)

### Integration Priority

**Product Line is CRITICAL for**:
- Service recommendation engine
- Practice assignment
- Historical pattern matching
- Cross-sell identification

**Recommendation**: Make Product Line a **required field** in Opportunity creation to maximize data quality and recommendation accuracy.
