## üéØ Recommendations

### 1. Create Unified Service Catalog

**Combine both sources for complete view**:

```
Unified Service Entry:
  - Service Name: "Storage Health Check"
  - Practice: "Hybrid Cloud Engineering" (from Services sheet)
  - Sub-Practice: "Storage" (from Services sheet)
  - Description: "Storage Performance Analysis" (from Services sheet)
  - SKU Code: "HM2P6A1#001" (from LS_SKU)
  - Applicable Products: "3PAR, Primera, Alletra, Alletra MP" (from LS_SKU)
  - Category: "Storage SW" (from LS_SKU)
```

### 2. Build Service Recommendation Engine

**Logic**:
1. Start with Install Base product
2. Match to LS_SKU category/product
3. Get available services with SKU codes
4. Enrich with Services sheet descriptions
5. Add practice context for bundling
6. Include historical A&PS project data for validation

### 3. Data Integration Approach

**Database Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE unified_service_catalog (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  service_name VARCHAR(255),
  service_description TEXT,  -- From Services sheet
  practice VARCHAR(100),      -- From Services sheet
  sub_practice VARCHAR(100),  -- From Services sheet
  sku_code VARCHAR(50),       -- From LS_SKU
  product_family VARCHAR(100),-- From LS_SKU
  product_category VARCHAR(50),-- From LS_SKU
  service_type VARCHAR(50),   -- Health Check, Migration, etc.
  created_at DATETIME
);

-- Mapping table
CREATE TABLE service_product_mapping (
  service_id INTEGER,
  product_family VARCHAR(100),
  FOREIGN KEY (service_id) REFERENCES unified_service_catalog(id)
);
```

### 4. Fuzzy Matching Configuration

**Recommended approach** (from analysis):
- **High confidence (85%+)**: Automatic mapping
- **Medium confidence (70-84%)**: Manual review required
- **Low confidence (60-69%)**: Flag for expert validation

### 5. Missing Services Identification

**Services in catalog but not in LS_SKU**:
- Data/AI services (analytics, ML, IoT)
- Consulting services (assessment, advisory)
- Cloud-native services (containers, Kubernetes)
- Application development services

**Action**: These may need separate SKU codes or different quoting process

**LS_SKU services not in catalog**:
- Some product-specific technical services
- Niche configuration services

**Action**: May be bundled into larger service offerings

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

**YES, there are strong connections between the sheets!**

The Services sheet and LS_SKU sheet are **highly complementary**:

- **LS_SKU**: Product-centric, tactical, includes SKU codes for ordering
- **Services Catalog**: Practice-centric, strategic, provides detailed descriptions
- **Together**: Complete service offering mapped to products with SKU codes and practice context

**Connection Rate**: 80.4% of services have mappings

**Business Value**:
1. ‚úÖ Product-driven service recommendations (what services for which products)
2. ‚úÖ SKU codes for quoting (from LS_SKU)
3. ‚úÖ Practice context for bundling (from Services)
4. ‚úÖ Historical validation (from A&PS Projects)

This mapping should be **integrated into the OneLead recommendation engine** to provide comprehensive, SKU-coded service recommendations organized by practice area.
