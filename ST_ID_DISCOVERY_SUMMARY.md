# üî• ST ID Relationship Discovery - Impact Analysis

**Date**: October 31, 2025
**Impact Level**: üî¥ **CRITICAL - Game Changer**

---

## Executive Summary

The discovery of the **ST ID** field in the A&PS Project table fundamentally changes our understanding of data relationships in OneLead, providing **100% project coverage** instead of the previously documented 47%.

---

## Before vs After Comparison

### üìä Coverage Statistics

| Metric | Before (v1.0) | After (v2.0) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Projects linked to accounts** | 1,118 (47%) | 2,394 (100%) | **+1,276 projects** |
| **Relationship type** | Linear chain | Triangular cycle | **Complete loop** |
| **Data completeness** | Partial | Complete | **53% more data** |
| **Accounts with project history** | 8 of 10 | 10 of 10 | **+2 accounts** |

### üîó Relationship Model Evolution

#### Version 1.0 (Linear Model)
```
Install Base (10 accounts)
    ‚Üì 80% coverage
Opportunity (8 accounts)
    ‚Üì 47% of projects
A&PS Project (1,118 linked, 1,276 orphaned)
    ‚Üì Practice mapping
Services
```

**Problem**: 1,276 projects (53%) appeared orphaned with no account linkage

#### Version 2.0 (Triangular Model) üî•
```
        Install Base (10 accounts)
             ‚Üì 80%        ‚Üë 100%
             ‚Üì              ‚Üë
        Opportunity    ST ID (NEW!)
             ‚Üì              ‚Üë
             ‚Üì 47%         ‚Üë
        A&PS Project (2,394 ALL linked)
                ‚Üì
            Services
```

**Solution**: ALL projects linked via ST ID creating complete circular relationship

## Account-Level Impact

### Accounts That Gained Project History

| Account | Before v1.0 | After v2.0 | Change |
|---------|------------|------------|--------|
| **56012** | ‚ùå No data (0 opportunities) | ‚úÖ 12 historical projects | **+12 projects** |
| **56240** | ‚ùå No data (0 opportunities) | ‚úÖ 13 historical projects | **+13 projects** |

### Complete Account 360¬∞ (All 10 Accounts)

| Account | Assets | Opportunities | Projects (v1.0) | Projects (v2.0) | Gain |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|------|
| 56088 | 15 | 52 | ~500 | 1,092 | +592 |
| 56769 | 30 | 9 | ~180 | 377 | +197 |
| 56180 | 1 | 12 | ~140 | 296 | +156 |
| 56623 | 5 | 8 | ~95 | 200 | +105 |
| 56322 | 1 | 8 | ~85 | 178 | +93 |
| 56160 | 1 | 5 | ~50 | 109 | +59 |
| 56396 | 1 | 3 | ~35 | 74 | +39 |
| 56166 | 7 | 1 | ~20 | 43 | +23 |
| 56012 | 1 | 0 | **0** | **12** | **+12** üî• |
| 56240 | 1 | 0 | **0** | **13** | **+13** üî• |

## Technical Details

### New Foreign Key Relationship

```sql
-- NEWLY DISCOVERED FK
A&PS_Project.ST_ID = Install_Base.Account_Sales_Territory_Id

-- Coverage
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_projects,
  COUNT(st_id) as projects_with_st_id,
  COUNT(st_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as coverage_pct
FROM aps_project;

Result:
  total_projects: 2,394
  projects_with_st_id: 2,394
  coverage_pct: 100.00%
```

### Updated Query Pattern (RECOMMENDED)

```sql
-- OLD METHOD (v1.0) - Only 47% coverage
SELECT *
FROM install_base ib
LEFT JOIN opportunity o ON ib.account_sales_territory_id = o.account_st_id
LEFT JOIN aps_project ap ON o.hpe_opportunity_id = ap.prj_siebel_id
-- Returns only 1,118 projects

-- NEW METHOD (v2.0) - 100% coverage ‚úÖ
SELECT *
FROM install_base ib
LEFT JOIN opportunity o ON ib.account_sales_territory_id = o.account_st_id
LEFT JOIN aps_project ap ON ib.account_sales_territory_id = ap.st_id
-- Returns ALL 2,394 projects
```

## Business Impact

### üéØ What This Enables

1. **Complete Customer History**
   - Every Install Base account now has full project history
   - Can analyze customer patterns across entire lifecycle
   - No more "data gaps" in customer journey

2. **Better Service Recommendations**
   - Historical delivery data informs future recommendations
   - Can reference past successful projects in proposals
   - Practice expertise visible for every account

3. **Accurate Win Rate Analysis**
   - Can compare opportunities vs actual project delivery
   - Track which product lines convert to services
   - Identify high-value customer patterns

4. **Resource Planning**
   - Complete view of practice workload by account
   - Historical success rates inform staffing decisions
   - Can predict future resource needs

5. **Previously Hidden Accounts Now Visible**
   - Accounts 56012 & 56240 appeared inactive (no opportunities)
   - Now visible with 12-13 projects each
   - Demonstrates ongoing HPE relationship despite no active pipeline

---

## Use Case Examples

### Before: Limited View
```
Account 56012:
  Install Base: 1 asset
  Opportunities: 0
  Projects: ‚ùå NONE VISIBLE

Assessment: "Inactive account, no recent engagement"
```

### After: Complete View
```
Account 56012:
  Install Base: 1 asset
  Opportunities: 0 (no active pipeline)
  Projects: ‚úÖ 12 historical projects

Assessment: "Active customer with regular service engagement,
             focus on project-based services vs new hardware"
```

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Immediate Actions

1. **Update all queries** to use ST ID for project joins
2. **Re-run customer segmentation** with complete project data
3. **Update dashboards** to show true account engagement levels
4. **Review accounts 56012 & 56240** for service renewal opportunities

### üìä Analysis Opportunities

1. **Practice affinity analysis** - which accounts prefer which practices
2. **Service penetration rates** - actual delivery vs install base size
3. **Customer lifecycle patterns** - time between projects, typical engagement length
4. **Win rate by account** - opportunities vs project conversion

### üîß Technical Implementation

1. **Update database schema** documentation to highlight ST ID as critical FK
2. **Create indexed views** using ST ID for performance
3. **Add data validation** to ensure ST ID is always populated
4. **Create helper functions** for common ST ID-based queries

---

## Conclusion

The discovery of the ST ID relationship is a **major breakthrough** that transforms our understanding of customer data relationships in OneLead. This changes the system from a **partial view** (47% coverage) to a **complete view** (100% coverage), enabling:

- ‚úÖ True customer 360¬∞ analysis
- ‚úÖ Complete historical context
- ‚úÖ Better service recommendations
- ‚úÖ Previously hidden customer relationships now visible
- ‚úÖ Triangular data model providing multiple analysis paths
