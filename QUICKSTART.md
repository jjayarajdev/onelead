## OneLead - Quick Start Guide

### Overview
OneLead is a sales intelligence system that identifies renewal opportunities, hardware refresh needs, and service gaps from your install base data.

### What We Built

**Data Loaded:**
- âœ… 63 install base records
- âœ… 98 opportunities
- âœ… 2,394 projects (historical)
- âœ… 286 services
- âœ… Service SKU mappings

**Leads Generated:**
- âœ… 30 renewal leads (expired support)
- âœ… 27 hardware refresh leads (EOL equipment)
- âœ… 20 service attach leads (coverage gaps)
- âœ… **77 total leads scored and prioritized**

### Quick Start

#### 1. Run the Dashboard (Enhanced Version)
```bash
streamlit run src/app/dashboard_v2.py
```

Or run the basic version:
```bash
streamlit run src/app/dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser with these views:
- **Dashboard**: Overview metrics and top leads
- **Lead Queue**: Filterable list of all leads with scores
- **Account 360Â°**: Complete view of any account
- **Territory View**: Territory-based lead management
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics and insights

#### 2. Refresh Data (Optional)
To reload data from Excel files:
```bash
python load_data.py
```

#### 3. Regenerate Leads (Optional)
To regenerate leads after data changes:
```bash
python generate_leads.py
```

### How It Works

#### Lead Identification
The system automatically scans install base for:
1. **Expired Support** â†’ Generates renewal leads
2. **EOL Equipment** (5+ years past end-of-life) â†’ Hardware refresh leads
3. **Uncovered Assets** (no service agreement) â†’ Service attach leads

#### Lead Scoring (0-100)
Each lead is scored based on:
- **Urgency (35%)**: How critical is the timing?
  - Days since EOL/support expiry
- **Value (30%)**: How valuable is the deal?
  - Estimated deal size + account install base size
- **Propensity (20%)**: How likely to close?
  - Open opportunities + historical projects
- **Strategic Fit (15%)**: How aligned with strategy?
  - Product family + business area

#### Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Score â‰¥ 75
- **HIGH**: Score 60-74
- **MEDIUM**: Score 40-59
- **LOW**: Score < 40

### Understanding the Data

#### Install Base Risk Levels
- **CRITICAL**: 5+ years past EOL with expired support
- **HIGH**: Expired support or 3+ years past EOL
- **MEDIUM**: All other statuses

#### Sample High-Priority Leads
Look for leads with:
- HP DL360p Gen8 servers (Gen8 = 2012, very old!)
- "Warranty Expired - Uncovered Box" status
- No service agreement IDs

These are prime candidates for:
1. Hardware refresh to Gen11
2. Support contract renewal
3. Migration services

---

### Next Steps

1. **Review Top Leads**: Start with the Dashboard's "Top Priority Leads"
2. **Filter by Territory**: Use Territory View to focus on your accounts
3. **Dive into Accounts**: Use Account 360Â° for complete customer intelligence
4. **Export Data**: (Future) Add CSV export functionality
5. **Create Opportunities**: (Future) One-click opportunity creation in CRM

---

### Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to customize:
- Scoring weights (urgency, value, propensity, strategic fit)
- Urgency thresholds (days past EOL, etc.)
- Lead type definitions
- Product family mappings
- Service bundle templates

---

### Troubleshooting

**Database is empty?**
Run: `python load_data.py`

**No leads showing?**
Run: `python generate_leads.py`

**Dashboard won't start?**
Check that Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit plotly`

**Want to start fresh?**
```bash
rm database/onelead.db
python load_data.py
python generate_leads.py
streamlit run src/app/dashboard.py
```
