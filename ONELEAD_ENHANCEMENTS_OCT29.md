# OneLead Complete - Changes Made on October 29, 2025

**Branch**: 29Oct
**Date**: October 29, 2025

---

## What Changed

### 1. Install Base - Show Actual Data Only

**What we did:**
- Removed calculated scores (Score: 64, Urgency: 80/100, etc.)
- Now shows real data from Excel: serial numbers, EOL dates, support status
- Changed from Lead table to InstallBase table

**Why:**
- Users wanted actual hardware data, not generated scores

---

### 2. Service Recommendations - Show 10 Services Instead of 1

**What we did:**
- Changed service search to look in service name AND practice fields
- Added keywords: Compute, Server, Storage, Network, etc.
- Now shows up to 10 relevant services per asset

**Why:**
- Before: Only 1 service shown ("Compute environment analysis services")
- After: 10 diverse services per hardware type

---

### 3. Organize by Categories - All Tabs

**What we did:**
- Added "Organize by" controls to all 3 main tabs
- Each tab has 3 view modes with collapsible sections
- Added "Show per category" limit (5, 10, 20, All)

**Install Base (63 assets):**
- Business Area | Support Status | Risk Level

**Ongoing Projects (452 projects):**
- Practice Area | Project Size | Priority

**Completed Projects:**
- Practice Area | Project Size | Completion Date

**Why:**
- Too many items to scroll through
- Needed better organization

---

### 4. Remove "All Opportunities" Tab

**What we did:**
- Deleted the first tab that showed all opportunities
- Went from 5 tabs to 4 tabs

**Why:**
- Redundant - each category has its own detailed tab now

---

### 5. Remove Footer Text

**What we did:**
- Removed "OneLead Complete - Built with Claude Code" text at bottom

**Why:**
- Cleaner interface

---

### 6. Add Visual Diagrams to Documentation

**What we did:**
- Added Mermaid diagram to DATA_RELATIONSHIPS_ANALYSIS.md
- Shows data flow between Install Base → Opportunity → Projects

**Why:**
- Easier to understand data relationships
